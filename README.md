# hello-world
My first repository

Born on the NoKaOi (The Best) island of Maui, city of Makawao,

A person that loves to learn everything new about technology, to keep myself updated or up to speed with all of the changes and additions to the newest technology released. I love to work with electronic devices, also love to connect all of them together to make them all work as one. With that being said, I have the ability to learn things very quickly as they are shown to me, or researched by me. I am the kind of person that continues to educate myself on my own time. On the month of November, I received 3 Certifications for Microsoft SQL Server for Beginners,  Microsoft SQL Server Master Class, and MySQL/phpMyAdmin Master Class Programming. I am currently enrolled in a Java Development for Beginners. I feel that technology will never stop advancing which means that I need to continue to take courses to keep up with everything that I learned while completing my Bachelors of Computer Science in Information Technology Degree.
